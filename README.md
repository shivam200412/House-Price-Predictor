#**House Price Prediction Model**
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The model is built using Python and popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

The goal of this project is to predict house prices using a dataset containing various features of houses. The model is trained using a regression algorithm, and the performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

The dataset used for this project is "California housing dataset", which contains the following features:
    - MedInc        median income in block group
    - HouseAge      median house age in block group
    - AveRooms      average number of rooms per household
    - AveBedrms     average number of bedrooms per household
    - Population    block group population
    - AveOccup      average number of household members
    - Latitude      block group latitude
    - Longitude     block group longitude
